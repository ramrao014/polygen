#formulas

Radius of Polygon (r) = a + np.random.randint(0,b) where a = radius of the circle with area equal to given lower area limit of polygon and b is equal to difference between radius of circle with area equal to given upper area limit of polygon and a. This allows the randomness of vertices.

Area of Polygon (area) = (r*r*s*(m.sin(angle)))/2 where s is equal to the number of sides of polygon and angle is between 0 tp 360 degrees. (Should be converted to radians in order to compute in py)
