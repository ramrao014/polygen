# polygen

A simple program to generate a Polygon given N no. of sides within a given area range of the polygon. Feel free to mess with it as per your need. All the formulas used are in the fomulas file.


Note : If you face any trouble installing or using the 'planar' package I recommend downloading and installing a compatible planar.whl file from the source : http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
